title:  "Day 2"

# Welcome

**Hello World**, this is my first Jekyll blog post.

Day 2. Already? I was incredibly nervous Sunday night, and now it's already day 2? 

Where will I be when this is all over? Hopefully, working as a software engineer where I can perform varying tasks and continue to learn. Although, I suppose choosing this field means I will be a lifelong learner by default. Eventually, maybe I'll end up at a small startup and will have the privilege of seeing all my hard work mean something. What an exciting prospect. 

I know, throughout this journey, there will be challenges and I suspect most of these challenges will be products of my self-doubt. Self-doubt created by difficult concepts and self-imposed expectations. I just have to remind myself it is okay to struggle and all that, but it is not okay to give up. Not right now. In those moments I will keep in mind what a close friend of mine said when I mentioned my interest in this field, "It's all about how much you're willing to struggle". And, oh boy, am I willing to struggle. 

My instructor, Mr. Lachlan, (is that too formal?), has been wonderful. Very knowledgeable and patient. Honestly, that is all I need. 

That is all for now, Blog Post. Baiiiiiii. 

Sincerely,
Mayra

p.s. I always produce a typo when typing "sincerely". k baiiii.
