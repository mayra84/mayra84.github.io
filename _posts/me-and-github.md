title: Me, Git, & Github

**Today, we began our journey with Git & Github.**

Git is a software which keeps track of any changes made to files. 
Github is a space where code is stored and programmers can collaborate. 
Git allows programmers to create projects and not feel confined or limited. They have the option to explore down a path and if they later decide they would rather have approached something differently, they can go back to a past version and go down a different path. 
Github is an incredible tool! Aside from providing a space to store code, it also provides something even more valuable: peace of mind! Github allows a programmer to save their work outside of their local computer. So if anything ever happens to the computer, they won't lose all their hard work! What a relief! 
The payoff to using Git and Github is they make everything flow better. Creating, exploring, collaborating, etc., are all just a few clicks away, thanks to Git and Github. This is not an ad.
